# Rehviproff Frontend Web Application
This is a React SPA (client) to access and handle the Rehviproff Backend API that is being created at the same time.

This app will have a sessioned user login, work order CRUD request and response handling and use best UX practices.

### To Start
clone the repo and cd into it
in terminal run "npm install"

### Development
in terminal run "npm start" (this will start a local dev hot loading server on port 3000: http://localhost:3000)

### Production
in terminal run "npm run build" (this will create a build folder that can be moved to rehviproff-webapp-backend root and is going to be served from there)
